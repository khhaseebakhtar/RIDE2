# RIDE2
Router Interface Details Extractor program for IP network planners &amp; network engineers

**Welcome to the Router's Inventory Detail Extractor (RIDE) project!**

I am Haseeb Akhtar, a seasoned Network Engineer with a robust background in designing, implementing, and managing complex network infrastructures. With extensive experience in working with various networking protocols and hardware, I have developed a keen interest in creating tools that enhance network management efficiency.

This project is a comprehensive solution aimed at extracting detailed inventory information from multiple routers simultaneously. Leveraging my expertise in network engineering and basic knowledge of python, I have designed this tool to streamline the process of network inventory management, making it easier for network administrators to gather and analyze data from numerous devices quickly. The tool currenlty supports Huawei and Juniper devices with Cisco's support under-development.

**Key features of this project include:**

**Scalability:** Capable of handling multiple routers at once, saving valuable time and effort.

**Detailed Data Extraction:** Retrieves extensive details about router interfaces, configurations, and statuses.

**User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning concepts of devops and python and really want to make Network Planning teams happy worldwide. ðŸ“« How to reach me: send me an Email at khwajahaseeb@yahoo.com or go to my linkedin page at https://www.linkedin.com/in/engr-haseebakhtar/ You are welcome to use,modify,distribute,sell,make a space rocket out of it... pretty much whatever you like
